## What is Power law
[Power law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law) is a relationship that well describes the behaviour of many phenomenons in nature - metabolism to size, time from learning to number of items forgotten, ratio of surface area to volume, etc.
In 2018 [Giovanni Santostasi](https://twitter.com/Giovann35084111) noticed that it works on Bitcoin's price too and so far it has held very well for KASPA as well, although KASPA's history is much shorter.
